<td VALIGN=TOP>The CFD General Notation System (CGNS) provides a general,
portable, and extensible standard for the storage and retrieval of
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis data.
It consists of a collection
of conventions, and free and open software implementing those conventions.
It is self-descriptive, machine-independent, well-documented, and administered by
an international steering committee.  It is also an American Institute of 
Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) <a href="CGNS_docs_current/aiaa.html">
Recommended Practice</a>.

<p>The system consists of two parts: (1) a standard format for recording the data, and
(2) software that reads, writes, and modifies data in that format.&nbsp;
The format is a conceptual entity established by the documentation; the
software is a physical product supplied to enable developers to access
and produce data recorded in that format.&nbsp;

<p>The CGNS system is designed to facilitate the exchange of data between
sites and applications, and to help stabilize the archiving of aerodynamic
data.&nbsp; The data are stored in a compact, binary format and are accessible
through a complete and extensible library of functions.&nbsp; The API (Application
Program Interface) is platform independent and can be easily implemented
in C, C++, Fortran and Fortran90 applications.&nbsp;

<p>How can CGNS help you?
<ul>
<li>It improves the longevity (archival quality) of data
<li>It makes it easier to share data files between sites and collaborators
<li>It is easily extendible to include almost any type of additional data you 
can think of
</ul>

<p>The CGNS project originated in 1994 as a joint effort between Boeing
and NASA, and has since grown to include many other contributing organizations
worldwide. In 1999, control of CGNS was completely transferred to a public
forum known as the <a href="steering.html">CGNS Steering Committee</a>.
This Steering Committee is made up of international representatives from
government and private industry.
Additional history on the development of CGNS is available 
<a href="CGNS_docs_current/overview/history.html">here</a>.&nbsp;

<p>The principal target of CGNS is data normally associated with compressible
viscous flow (i.e., the Navier-Stokes equations), but the standard is also
applicable to subclasses such as Euler and potential flows.
The CGNS standard includes the following types of data.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Structured, unstructured, and hybrid grids</li>

<li>
Flow solution data, which may be nodal, cell-centered, face-centered, or
edge-centered</li>

<li>
Multizone interface connectivity, both abutting and overset</li>

<li>
Boundary conditions</li>

<li>
Flow equation descriptions, including the equation of state, viscosity
and thermal conductivity models, turbulence models, multi-species chemistry
models, and electromagnetics</li>

<li>
Time-dependent flow, including moving and deforming grids</li>

<li>
Dimensional units and nondimensionalization information</li>

<li>
Reference states</li>

<li>
Convergence history</li>

<li>
Association to CAD geometry definitions</li>

<li>
User-defined data&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

Much of the standard and the software is applicable to computational field
physics in general. Disciplines other than fluid dynamics would need to
augment the data definitions and storage conventions, but the fundamental
database software, which provides platform independence, is not specific
to fluid dynamics.
