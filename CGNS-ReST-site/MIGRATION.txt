The migration is supposed to be a straightforward translation from a doc
format to another. This is not exactly the case, the first reason is that some
parts have be written for paper docs, with duplicated parts. The second is
the use of the reference links which implies some doc hierarchy reorganisation.

The existing pages of the original reference web site are sometimes
kept unchanged, sometime reorganized. No information is deleted, some
were duplicated.

The syntax for the following change log is:

(OLD-PAGE#SECTION, ...) -> (NEW-PAGE#SECTION, ...)
 - CHANGES

please look carefully at the ??? marks. These are indicating some parts
of the pages that look weird, obsolete, redundant. These have been included
in this migration to make sure no information is missed by the migration
before any re-writing.
