CGNS/Python - A Python implementation
=====================================

The CGNS/Python mapping defines a tree structure composed of nodes implemented
for the `Python programming language <https://www.python.org/>`_.
A special links structure is also defined for a correct mapping of the management
of files on the disk. The mapping presented here is **not** a library, it is the 
lowest possible correspondence between a :ref:`CGNS/SIDS<CGNS-SIDS>` structure and
a Python representation. This specification is public and can be used as the basis
for Python based CGNS application interoperability. Python is an interpreted language
and it has a textual representation of its objects, this representation can be used
for CGNS/Python trees as well.

The python documentation is not up-to-date (v3.1.2).

Currently the documentation is only available as a PDF files:
